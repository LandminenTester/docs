## Recipe configuration

Below is a detailed explanation of the recipe configuration options available:

```lua
{
    label = "Sugar", -- This is the label that gets displayed in the book

    category = "production", -- This is the category that gets displayed in the book

    recipeImage = "sugar", -- This is the image that gets displayed in the book (itemname -> image from inventory)

    neededSkills = { -- These are the skills that are needed to craft the item. If not set, the player can craft the item without any skills.
    },

    --failChance = 10, -- This is the chance that the player will fail the recipe. If the player fails, they will lose the items needed.

    receivingExp = { -- These are the skills exp that are gained when the item is crafted.
        {skill = "drugs", exp = 1, label = "Sugarfactory"},
    },

    needed = { -- These are the items that are needed to craft the item.
        {label = "Sugarcube", item = "sugar", amount = 1},
    },

    duration = 3, -- This is the duration of the recipe in seconds.

    retrieve = { -- This is the item list that is retrieved when the item is crafted.
        {item = "sugar", label = "Sugarcube", amount = 2}, -- Item that gets given to the player
    },

    tools = {}, -- These are the tools that are needed to craft the item. With useDurability set to true, the tool
    -- will lose durability when used. If false, it will not have durability, just need the item to be in the player's inventory.

    giveback = {
        {item = "sugar", label = "Sugarcube", amount = 2}, -- Item that gets given to the player
    }, -- This is the item list that is given back to the player when the item is crafted.

    requireJobLocation = false, -- When this is set to true, the player must be in the job location of their current set job to craft the item.
    -- specialLocation = {"rho_special_location"}, -- This is the list of polyzones where the player can craft the item. Cannot be used with requireJobLocation.

    disclaimer = "This is a disclaimer text, to be displayed to the player.", -- This is the disclaimer text that gets displayed in orange above the craft button.

    description = "Here you can write an amazing description for your recipe or tell the player what they can do with it." -- This is the description text that gets displayed below the recipe title in the details tab.
}
```

## Prompt keys

You can adjust the prompt key and hold time in the config file.

```lua
Config.PromptKey = 0xB2F377E8 -- A
Config.PromptHoldTime = 1000 -- 1 second (If you want to have a button and not a hold event, set this to 0)
```

Here you can find a list of all the prompt keys:

```lua

}
```

## Add blips to crafting locations

If you want to add blips to crafting locations, you can add BlipSettings to a crafting location.
Here is an example of how to do it:

```lua
Config.CraftingLocations = {
	{coords={-292.9522, 792.5771, 118.5612, 62.4914},book = "drugs_book",label ="Example Book for as Prompt", jobs= false, BlipSettings = {name = "Example Book", sprite = "blip_ambient_tithing", color = "PINKISH"} }, 
}
```

You set BlipSettings with a name, sprite and color. If you dont have BlipSettings in the line then it will not show a blip.

### Possible colors

Here you can see all the possible colors you can use for the blip.

```lua
    --LIGHT_BLUE 
    --DARK_RED     
    --PURPLE       
    --ORANGE       
    --TEAL         
    --LIGHT_YELLOW 
    --PINK         
    --GREEN        
    --DARK_TEAL    
    --RED          
    --LIGHT_GREEN  
    --TEAL2        
    --BLUE         
    --DARK_PUPLE   
    --DARK_PINK    
    --DARK_DARK_RED
    --GRAY         
    --PINKISH      
    --YELLOW_GREEN 
    --DARK_GREEN    
    --BRIGHT_BLUE   
    --BRIGHT_PURPLE 
    --YELLOW_ORANGE 
    --BLUE2         
    --TEAL3         
    --TAN           
    --OFF_WHITE     
    --LIGHT_YELLOW2 
    --LIGHT_PINK    
    --LIGHT_RED     
    --LIGHT_YELLOW3 
    --WHITE         
```
