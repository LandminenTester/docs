```

## Recipe configuration

Below is a detailed explanation of the recipe configuration options available:

```lua
{
    label = "Sugar", -- This is the label that gets displayed in the book

    category = "production", -- This is the category that gets displayed in the book

    recipeImage = "sugar", -- This is the image that gets displayed in the book (itemname -> image from inventory)

    neededSkills = { -- These are the skills that are needed to craft the item. If not set, the player can craft the item without any skills.
        {skill = "drugs", progress = 1, label = "Drogen"},
    },

    neededJobs = { -- These are the jobs that are needed to see the item in the craftingbook. If not set, the player can see the recipe.
        { job = "sd_woodworker", grade = 1 },
    },

    --failChance = 10, -- This is the chance that the player will fail the recipe. If the player fails, they will lose the items needed.

    receivingExp = { -- These are the skills exp that are gained when the item is crafted.
        {skill = "drugs", exp = 1, label = "Sugarfactory"},
    },

    needed = { -- These are the items that are needed to craft the item.
        {label = "Sugarcube", item = "sugar", amount = 1},
    },

    duration = 3, -- This is the duration of the recipe in seconds.

    retrieve = { -- This is the item list that is retrieved when the item is crafted.
        {item = "sugar", label = "Sugarcube", amount = 2}, -- Item that gets given to the player
    },

    tools = {}, -- These are the tools that are needed to craft the item. With useDurability set to true, the tool
    -- will lose durability when used. If false, it will not have durability, just need the item to be in the player's inventory.

    giveback = {
        {item = "sugar", label = "Sugarcube", amount = 2}, -- Item that gets given to the player
    }, -- This is the item list that is given back to the player when the item is crafted.

    requireJobLocation = false, -- When this is set to true, the player must be in the job location of their current set job to craft the item.
    -- specialLocation = {"rho_special_location"}, -- This is the list of polyzones where the player can craft the item. Cannot be used with requireJobLocation.

    disclaimer = "This is a disclaimer text, to be displayed to the player.", -- This is the disclaimer text that gets displayed in orange above the craft button.

    description = "Here you can write an amazing description for your recipe or tell the player what they can do with it." -- This is the description text that gets displayed below the recipe title in the details tab.
}
```

## Book configuration

Below is a detailed explanation of the recipe configuration options available:

```lua
["drugs_book"] = {          --This is the book name must be same as the item 
    item = "drugs_book",    --Here you enter the item name of the book you want to make usable if false the book is not binded to a item and can only be used with the prompt methodes
    command = "sugarbook",  -- /sugarbook opens the book if set to "command = nil" then its disabled or when the line is removed
    label = "Example Book", --This is the label that gets displayed in the book top left corner
    jobs = false,           --This is the job setting for the book, if false any job can access this book. If a list of jobs, only those jobs can access this book.
    skillList = {           --This is the skill list that gets displayed in the book with progressbars, you can decide if you want to display the skill in the book or not.
        {
            label = "Sugarfactory", --This is the label that gets displayed in the book
            skill = "drugs", --This is the skill name like in the vorp core skills.lua
        },
        {
            label = "Schreiner", --This is the label that gets displayed in the book
            skill = "woodwork", --This is the skill name like in the vorp core skills.lua
        },
    },
    categorys = {
        ["production"] = "Produce", --this is the category and its label that gets displayed in the book

    },
    categoryImages = {
        ["production"] = "sugar", --this is the category and the image that gets displayed in the book (itemname -> image from inventory)

    },

    categoryJobFilter = { -- This is the job filter for the category. If not set, the player can see the recipes in the category when he can open the book.
        -- When you set a job filter, the player can only see the category when he has the job and the grade. This filters all recipes of a category out without checking requirements set for a specific recipe in this category.
        ["production"] = {
            { job = "sd_woodworker", grade = 1 },
        },
    },

    recipes = {
        ...
    },
}
```

## Prompt keys

You can adjust the prompt key and hold time in the config file.

```lua
Config.PromptKey = 0xB2F377E8 -- A
Config.PromptHoldTime = 1000 -- 1 second (If you want to have a button and not a hold event, set this to 0)
```

Here you can find a list of all the prompt keys:

```lua
Source: https://forum.cfx.re/t/keybind-hashes/1666877/3

keys = {
    -- Letters

    ["A"] = 0x7065027D, ["B"] = 0x4CC0E2FE, ["C"] = 0x9959A6F0, ["D"] = 0xB4E465B4, ["E"] = 0xCEFD9220, ["F"] = 0xB2F377E8,
    ["G"] = 0x760A9C6F, ["H"] = 0x24978A28, ["I"] = 0xC1989F95, ["J"] = 0xF3830D8E, ["K"] = Missing, ["L"] = 0x80F28E95,
    ["M"] = 0xE31C6A41, ["N"] = 0x4BC9DABB (Push to talk key), ["O"] = 0xF1301666, ["P"] = 0xD82E0BD2, ["Q"] = 0xDE794E3E,
    ["R"] = 0xE30CD707, ["S"] = 0xD27782E3, ["T"] = Missing, ["U"] = 0xD8F73058, ["V"] = 0x7F8D09B8, ["W"] = 0x8FD015D8,
    ["X"] = 0x8CC9CD42, ["Y"] = Missing, ["Z"] = 0x26E9DC00

    -- Symbol Keys

    ["RIGHTBRACKET"] = 0xA5BDCD3C, ["LEFTBRACKET"] = 0x430593AA

    -- Mouse buttons

    ["MOUSE1"] = 0x07CE1E61, ["MOUSE2"] = 0xF84FA74F, ["MOUSE3"] = 0xCEE12B50, ["MWUP"] = 0x3076E97C

    -- Modifier Keys

    ["CTRL"] = 0xDB096B85, ["TAB"] = 0xB238FE0B, ["SHIFT"] = 0x8FFC75D6, ["SPACEBAR"] = 0xD9D0E1C0, ["ENTER"] = 0xC7B5340A,
    ["BACKSPACE"] = 0x156F7119, ["LALT"] = 0x8AAA0AD4, ["DEL"] = 0x4AF4D473, ["PGUP"] = 0x446258B6, ["PGDN"] = 0x3C3DD371,

    -- Function Keys

    ["F1"] = 0xA8E3F467, ["F4"] = 0x1F6D95E5, ["F6"] = 0x3C0A40F2

    -- Number Keys

    ["1"] = 0xE6F612E4, ["2"] = 0x1CE6D9EB, ["3"] = 0x4F49CC4C, ["4"] = 0x8F9F9E58, ["5"] = 0xAB62E997, ["6"] = 0xA1FDE2A6,
    ["7"] = 0xB03A913B, ["8"] = 0x42385422

    -- Arrow Keys

    ["DOWN"] = 0x05CA7C52, ["UP"] = 0x6319DB71, ["LEFT"] = 0xA65EBAB4, ["RIGHT"] = 0xDEB34313,
}
```

## Add blips to crafting locations

If you want to add blips to crafting locations, you can add BlipSettings to a crafting location.
Here is an example of how to do it:

```lua
Config.CraftingLocations = {
	{coords={-292.9522, 792.5771, 118.5612, 62.4914},book = "drugs_book",label ="Example Book for as Prompt", jobs= false, BlipSettings = {name = "Example Book", sprite = "blip_ambient_tithing", color = "PINKISH"} },
}
```

You set BlipSettings with a name, sprite and color. If you dont have BlipSettings in the line then it will not show a blip.

### Possible colors

Here you can see all the possible colors you can use for the blip.

```lua
    --LIGHT_BLUE
    --DARK_RED
    --PURPLE
    --ORANGE
    --TEAL
    --LIGHT_YELLOW
    --PINK
    --GREEN
    --DARK_TEAL
    --RED
    --LIGHT_GREEN
    --TEAL2
    --BLUE
    --DARK_PUPLE
    --DARK_PINK
    --DARK_DARK_RED
    --GRAY
    --PINKISH
    --YELLOW_GREEN
    --DARK_GREEN
    --BRIGHT_BLUE
    --BRIGHT_PURPLE
    --YELLOW_ORANGE
    --BLUE2
    --TEAL3
    --TAN
    --OFF_WHITE
    --LIGHT_YELLOW2
    --LIGHT_PINK
    --LIGHT_RED
    --LIGHT_YELLOW3
    --WHITE
```
