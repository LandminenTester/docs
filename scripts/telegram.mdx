- Send bulk messages to multiple players
- Have a addressbook with a note system that you see in the send message dropdown menu when selecting a contact

## Events

Here you can find events that you can listen for to make specific actions when a recipe is crafted or failed.
```lua
--Client Events

("brew_telegram:openStation", cityLabel)
 -- This event is triggered when a recipe is failed.
 -- Parameters:
 -- cityLabel: string -- The citylabel of the station


```

## Exports

With this export you can open a specific station from the client side. This allows you to create your own opening methods for a telegram station.
```lua
--Client Seitig
exports.brew_telegram:openStation(cityLabel)
```

## Translation

To translate the telegram system, you need to adjust the language settings in the config.lua and the scripts.js file.
Also there are some values you need to adjust in the index.html to fully translate the system.

## Prompt keys

You can adjust the prompt key in the config file.

```lua
Config.PromptKey = 0xB2F377E8 -- F
```

Here you can find a list of all the prompt keys:
