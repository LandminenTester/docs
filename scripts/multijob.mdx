# Brew Multijob: Advanced Job Management System

Brew Multijob is a comprehensive system designed to manage multiple jobs for players seamlessly. It provides an intuitive interface and efficient backend to handle job swaps and data retrieval, enhancing player interaction and server management.

## Features

- **Effortless job management** for players
- **Intuitive interface** for seamless interaction
- **Efficient backend** for quick data retrieval and job swaps
- **Server-side only**

## How to use the commands

To use the commands, you need to have the ace command permission on your server.
Here is a example to enable all commands for the admin group. 
You need to replace identifier: with a valid identifier of you or the person you want to give the permission to.

```lua
add_ace group.admin command allow
add_principal identifier: .... group.admin
```

If you want to give only the permission to a specific command, you can use the following command.
Here a example to give the permission to the multijob command to the admin group.

```lua
add_ace group.admin command.multijob allow
add_principal identifier: .... group.admin
```

You can also create own groups and give the permission to them.
As small additional information for developers: This function is used on the server side to check if player got a specific permission.

```lua
if IsPlayerAceAllowed(playerSource, "the.permission.name.you.want") then
    -- do your code here
end
```
